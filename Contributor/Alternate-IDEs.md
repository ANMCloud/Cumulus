# [Home](http://developer.salesforcefoundation.org/Cumulus/Contributor/) > Alternate IDEs

In addition to the Force.com IDE, there are a number of third-party IDEs for Salesforce development. These include [MavensMate](http://mavensmate.com/), IntelliJ IDEA with [Illuminated Cloud](http://www.illuminatedcloud.com/), and [the Welkin Suite](https://welkinsuite.com/). You can even remain an old school vi user, and use the command line and a combination of CumulusCI tasks and flows to do all your NPSP related development.

Unlike with the Force.com IDE, when using other IDEs you may want to keep your git repository and your IDE’s source repository separate. Alternatively, you can do your development directly in through your browser in Salesforce with the Developer Console, and not use an IDE at all.

# Yipee!

Now you’re ready to [start coding](Do-the-Work.html)!
